 VLM-5030 Voice Emulation Playground

This repository is a sandbox for experimenting with **VLM-5030 style voice effects**.  
The idea: ask Codex (or any code-generation LLM) to produce multiple Python scripts that process audio in different ways, then compare the outputs by ear and keep the ones you like.

## Overview

- **Goal**: Approximate the sound of the Sanyo VLM-5030 speech IC (used in 1980s Konami arcade games).
- **Method**: Generate multiple Python implementations (e.g., FFmpeg wrapper, SciPy filter chain, simple LPC analysis) and test them side by side.
- **Workflow**: Record or provide a voice sample (`input.wav`), run different scripts, and listen to which output best captures the retro arcade “speech chip” vibe.

## Repository Structure

.
├── input.wav # Your test voice sample
├── vlmish_ffmpeg.py # Example: FFmpeg-based filter approach
├── vlmish_scipy.py # Example: bandpass + quantization using SciPy
├── vlmish_lpc.py # Example: crude LPC-based resynthesis
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
└── README.md # This file



> **Note**: The actual Python files are generated by Codex or edited manually.  
> The filenames above are only a suggested convention.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/vlm5030-playground.git
   cd vlm5030-playground
Install Python dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Typical dependencies:

numpy

scipy

soundfile

Optionally install SoX or FFmpeg for external processing:


# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install sox ffmpeg
Usage
Place your voice sample as input.wav in the root folder.
Example: record your own voice saying “Hadoken!” or “Ready Go!”.

Run one of the generated scripts:


python vlmish_ffmpeg.py input.wav vlmish1.wav
python vlmish_scipy.py input.wav vlmish2.wav
python vlmish_lpc.py   input.wav vlmish3.wav
Listen to the results (vlmish1.wav, vlmish2.wav, vlmish3.wav) and decide which effect you prefer.

Suggested Codex Prompt
When using Codex to generate multiple implementations in one shot:

“Write Python code that processes input.wav into three different retro VLM-5030 style outputs: (1) FFmpeg/SoX wrapper, (2) SciPy/Numpy filter + quantization, (3) simple LPC-based resynthesis. Each method should be a separate function writing to vlmish1.wav, vlmish2.wav, vlmish3.wav.”

This way you can directly compare all variants in one run.

Notes
This project is for educational and creative purposes.

The original VLM-5030 chip used external speech ROMs; this repo does not emulate ROM data, only approximates the “sound character”.

If you want deeper accuracy, check MAME’s vlm5030.c source or FPGA Arcade documentation.
